# AudioVisualization
Most recent version of repos titled JavaAV and AudioProject. Main changes are in the Audio engine.
Instead of using the processing sound library, I used jAsioHost for much lower latency times. 
Since I was using processing sound for the FFT I also switched that to use jTransforms.
Still in the process of migrating the shader files over, but there are a few in there to start with.
